git stash is a command used to temporarily save changes in your working directory and staging area (index) that youâ€™re not ready to commit. This allows you to clean your working directory and switch branches or perform other tasks without losing your uncommitted changes.

Some commands related to stashing process:

1) git stash: This command saves the current state of your working directory and index, creating a new stash entry and reverting your working directory to the state of the last commit.

2) git stash push -m "message": Adds a descriptive message to your stash, making it easier to identify later.

3) git stash list: Displays a list of all stash entries, each with an identifier like stash@{0}, stash@{1}, etc.
